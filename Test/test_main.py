Test Script: test_main.py
Description: Tests the orchestration and integration logic in `main.py`.

Run Instructions:
    pytest test_main.py

Preparation Instructions:
    - Ensure all modules (`main.py`, `DirectoryScanner`, `FileProcessor`, etc.) are updated and functional.
    - Mock any external dependencies such as GitHub or database connections to avoid impacting production systems.

Reset Instructions:
    - Remove any test artifacts (e.g., test files or directories) created during the test.
